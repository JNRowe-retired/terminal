Introduction
============

Terminal is designed for creating terminal-base tools, written in Python,
for developers who like simple and beautiful things.

import this
-----------

Terminal was developed with a few :pep:`20` idioms in mind::

    >>> import this


#. Beautiful is better than ugly.
#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

All contributions to Terminal should keep these important rules in mind.
